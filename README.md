# HMC_methods
Github repo for my hamiltonian monte carlo/NUTS work
Just a general folder for my work on HMC/NUTS/MCMC methods and some extras surrounding it 
there are still bugs in the NUTS parts to do with step size adaption in HMC_DA but I will 
try and get round to fixing it. All this is just so I have somewhere to store my work and 
keep me honest tbh.
